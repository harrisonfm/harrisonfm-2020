### The HarrisonFM theme for the 2020's.

This is my second go at a fully functional headless theme, and a much more robust offering. This time, we have Vue and the Wordpress REST API combining to make a rich theme to highlight my photography, writing and code.

Special thanks to the [vuejs-wordpress-theme-starter](https://github.com/EvanAgee/vuejs-wordpress-theme-starter) for getting me started on this.
